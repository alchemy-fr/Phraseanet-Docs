Report An Issue
===============

You're facing an issue ? The result of an action is not what was expected ?
You can not activate an optoon ? You want to ask a new option to make Phraseanet
se more easy ?

Then you have to open an issue, but please before that, consider the following
rules :

 * You are sure you got the latest Phraseanet version
 * You are sure your system has been patched after the 
   :doc:`update </Admin/Upgrade>`
 * Your issue can always be reproduced when chaining some simple actions.
 * You have read the :doc:`FAQ </Admin/Faq>` for help for known issues
 * You are sure `your problem has not already been reported 
   <https://github.com/alchemy-fr/Phraseanet/issues/>`_

If this is OK (pfiou !), `open an issue
<https://github.com/alchemy-fr/Phraseanet/issues>`_ with, if available, a
`gist <https://gist.github.com/>`_ of the output of :

  .. code-block:: bash

      bin/console system:doctor

Be sure to :
 * Never just copy/paste the result
 * Give the simplest way to reproduce your issue step by step
 * Give the browser you're using and the version.
