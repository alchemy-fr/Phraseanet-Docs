Report An Issue
===============

You're facing an issue ? The result of an action is not what was expected ?
You can not activate an optoon ? You want to ask a new option to make Phraseanet
se more easy ?

Then you have to open an issue, but please before that, consider the following
rules :

* You are sure you got the latest Phraseanet version
* You are sure your system has been patched after the
  :doc:`update </Admin/Upgrade>`
* Your issue can always be reproduced when chaining some simple actions.
* You have read the :doc:`FAQ </Admin/Faq>` for help for known issues
* You are sure your problem has not already been reported in the `bug tracker`_

If this is OK (pfiou !), open an issue in the `bug tracker`_ with a `gist`_ of
the output of :

.. code-block:: bash

    bin/console system:doctor

Be sure to :

* Never just copy/paste the result
* Give the simplest way to reproduce your issue step by step
* Give the browser you're using and the version.
