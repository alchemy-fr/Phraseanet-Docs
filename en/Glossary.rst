    FTP
        FTP is a standard network protocol used for massive documents
        sending over network.

    Document
        A document is the original file added to a Phraseanet Base/Collection.

    Subviews
        These files are generated when a document is added. They are classified
        in three groups (Everybody/Preview/Documents) and are linked to
        the user rights.

    Description
        Document's fact sheet, is made of different fields.

    Metadata
        Literally a data on a data. More precisely, it's a package of
        structured information describing a random resource. Metadatas are
        located inside the file. The :term:`IPTC`, the :term:`XMP` and the
        :term:`EXIF` are standards metadata used in a JPEG file for example.
        Metadata can be used, depending on their type, in read-only mode or
        read-write mode.

    Indexation
        Process that allows to link a description to a document through a
        metadata extraction, or a description entry.

    Status
        Customizable variable of boolean type (Yes/No) allowing to characterise
        some records. It is possible to define and allocate up to 28 more status
        on a document, 4 status are dedicated (for a total of 32 status).

    Record
        A record is a document or a story in Phraseanet. As a single entity,
        this digital *Asset* has a unique descriptive sheet (in XML), of one
        or more documents and given sub resolutions (thumbnails, preview images,
        key images for stories...*etc*.).

    Phraseanet Base
        A Phraseanet base is a MySQL container (database instance). It has among
        others, a documentary structure « indexation fields » and generally some
        other settings. A Phraseanet base can contain one, or several Phraseanet
        Collections that will use the original Phraseanet base settings. The
        Phraseanet base fundamentals are highlighted in *Phraseanet
        Administration* and *Thesaurus*.

    Collection
        A collection is a subset of a Phraseanet base. It allows to implement
        a data segmentation, based on workflow needs or data separation in
        accordance with subjective criteria (type of document, year of the
        shooting...*etc*.).

    Basket
        A basket is a set including :term:`records <Record>`.
        A basket belongs to the user who created it. A basket can be
        transferred by a Push or through a *Phraseanet* Feedback.

    Story
        A story is composed by a set of documents, that must come from a single
        Phraseanet base composed by one or more collections. A story has its own
        documentary sheet, it is thus a record. A document can belong to
        several stories.

    IPTC (IPTC Metadatas)
        The IPTC metadata are a set of metadata attributes that allows to
        describe media data.

    IPTC
        The IPTC (International Press and Telecommunications Council) is a
        consortium regrouping press agencies, press and software editors that
        develops and maintain standards for information exchange fairly used in
        the media industry. More than twenty years ago, in order to facilitate
        information exchange related to media, the main idea of the IPTC was to
        implement metadata in the documents itself, in file headers. One
        advantage is that the description of the document is integrated
        in the document itself. Since then, the metadatas IPTC never stopped
        evolving, adapting to the needs of the Information Society.
