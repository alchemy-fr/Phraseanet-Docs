.. topic:: The essential

    A Phraseanet application is organized in :term:`bases <Phraseanet Base>` and
    :term:`collections <Collection>`.
    Each bases corresponds to a customizable documentary structure, a
    collections can be considered as base subsets.

Databases start screen lists available databoxes on the application.

Two forms allow:

* **Creating additionnal databases**
* **Mounting existing databases**

.. Seealso::

  :doc:`Refer to FAQ about creating and mounting additionnal databases<../../FAQ/Media/Add-a-base>`.

Click on a database name to start it customization.

.. _Setting-Structure:

Customization per base
----------------------

A database start screen display its status.

The screen shows the indexation state of the base and allows the following
actions:

* Set labels language
* Create Collections
* Logs deletion
* Base removal
* Purge of records
* Base deletion
* Base re-indexation

As a multi-bases system, each base of a Phraseanet instance is finely
customizable. Click on the **+** icon in order to reveal its sub-menu.

Setting the structure
*********************

This section displays the documentary structure of the selected base as a
XML file.

    :align: center

It's unlikely to have to customize a base using this interface, the interfaces
`Fields`_ , `Subviews`_ or `Status setup`_ are more convenient to change
settings.

Fields
******

The section **Fields** allows to define and edit the documentary structure of a
Phraseanet base using forms in a graphical interface.

.. image:: ../../images/Administration-structurechamps.jpg
    :align: center

Each of these fields of the documentary structure is defined by customizable
properties:

* A unique name
* A type, mono or multi valued for String and Text
* Labels depending on the interface languages
* A mandatory presence or not
* An optional data source
* An optional :term:`Dublin Core` source
* An optional :term:`business field <Business field>` property
* The order

.. note::

    **The field types are linked to the Phrasea engine**.

    :doc:`Refer to the fields type information of the FAQ <../../FAQ/Settings/Phrasea-field-types>`.

Subviews
********

The *Subviews* section allows to add and edit the media subviews files
for picture, videos, audio, office other multimedia documents type integrated
in Phraseanet.

documents integrated in Phraseanet.
The table below lists some typical examples of subviews generated by Phraseanet.
