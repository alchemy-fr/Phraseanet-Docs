    The *Phraseanet* menu bar allows to access the different interfaces of the
    application, the user account settings and some information and resources.

Access to interfaces
--------------------

All the *Phraseanet* interfaces offer a menu bar at the top of their windows.

**The left part of the menu bar displays the list of the interfaces that the
user can access.** Click on an application's name to launch the application in
a new tab or a new window of the web navigator.

**The sections in the menu bar depend on the users rights.**

If a user does not have access to some features, the link toward the interface
exploiting it will not appear in the menu bar.
So, users who have only viewing rights on assets have access to a limited number
of sections.
