General information
-------------------

*Phraseanet* is a DAM system, a Digital Asset Management solution.

It's aimed to all professionals who need a powerful tool to secure the
management and broadcast of their images, videos, sounds and other multimedia
or office documents.

Installed either on a local or remote server, it runs through a Web browser.

To use Phraseanet
-----------------

The user must have a computer equipped with internet and a recent internet
browser. JavaScript support must be activated and
`Adobe Flash Player <http://get.adobe.com/fr/flashplayer/>`_ plug-in installed.

The user must also have a valid email address.

.. note::

    On Windows PC, Internet Explorer 7 is the minimum recommended version.
    However, Phraseanet Classic allows access using obsolete Web browsers such
    as Internet Explorer 6.

    The use of Internet Explorer 6 is not recommended for the other Phraseanet
    interfaces, as it is not recommended to use *Phraseanet Classic* with recent
    browsers.
