.. topic:: The essential

    *Push* and *Feedback* are two actions intended to transmit documents to
    users, whether or not they have originally a Phrasenaet account.

    A *Push* is used to push media toward users. A *Feeback* is intended to
    collect advisory opinions about media from them.

    A :ref:`Lists manager <List-Manager>` allows to create sending lists to
    answer some repetitive sending towards the same users.
