    The *Push* and the *Validation* are two actions intended to transmit
    documents to users, whether they have Phraseanet accounts or not.

    The *Push* is used to push documents toward those users, the *Validation*,
    is intended to collect advisory opinion from the users about media.

    A `Lists manager`_ allows to create sending lists to answer some
    repetitive sending towards the same users.

The Push
--------

The Push is a submission of documents or baskets of documents. Reversely to an
e-mail export, the *Push* does not physically transmit the documents. It
notifies in the interface, and also notifies by e-mail, and leave at the users
disposal some media selections coming from baskets that they can consult and
eventually download.

Push documents
**************

* **Select one or several documents** in the results display area or in an
  opened basket or open a story in the work area.

* **Click on the Push button** of one of the Actions palette :

In the Push window...

* **Select one or several users*** to push toward them the selected
  documents.

To do so, enter their family names, first names or e-mail address in the form
field on the top left of the interface. An auto-completion system is activated
as soon as the third character is entered in order to facilitate users search.
Once the Phraseanet user is detected in the suggested users list, click on his
name in order to add him to the sending list.

**To add one or several non registered users** in a Phraseanet account base to a
sending list, click on the link **Add a user**.
Fill in at least the mandatory fields recognizable by an asterisk then click
on the "Add" button. The contact is created and added to the recipients area and
his account is created.

.. note::

    The users listed in the recipient area can be gathered and saved in the
    sending list.

    To save a sending list, fill in the fields of the form located on the left
    of the recipient area then save by clicking on the icon :

        :align: center

    The created list is then displayed in the sending lists area.

.. seealso::

    Refer to the functionalities of the :ref:`list manager<Push-Manager>`.

.. warning::

    To be able to create users from Pushes and Validations, the user must have
    the required users management rights.

To grant some specific rights on high definition downloads,(or *Grant rights*)
on the documents pushed to users of the sending list, two methods are available:

* Select one or several users in the recipient area, then click on the
   *HD download* button located on the left of the sending users list.

**Or**,

* Click on the icon located on the representative sticker of each recipient to
  grant the right for a high definition download.

* Click on the *Send* button to validate and to transmit the Push.

A form is available to give a name, a description to the sending and to request,
if needed, an acknowledgement receipt of the email if this function is supported
by the recipients mail boxes.

The Validation
--------------

The operating mode is nearly identical to a Push sending. The only difference is
the giving out of additional or optional benefits.

* Select one or several documents in the results display area or an opened
  basket or open a story in the work area.
* Click on the Validation section of the Phraseanet's actions palette of the
  Push menu of a basket or opened story in the work area.

**In the validation window**,

* Select the Phraseanet user(s) who will receive the Validation request. To
  address this request to non-registered users on the application, the operating
  mode is also the same as for a Push.

The increase of additional rights (the *Grant Rights*) works the same way as a
Push. Rights that can be elevated are more dense :

* **The High Definition download** to grant access to the sub-definitions of the
  documents class
* **The contribution** to validation, default option that allows to give an
  opinion on the documents
* **See others** allows the recipient to view the opinions and comments of the
  other users part of the validation

To validate and transmit a Validation request, click on the *Send* button.
A form allows to set the period of validity of a Validation request, and
to give it a friendly name and description, these items are included in the
email received by the recipients.
To request an acknowledgement receipt of the Validation request, check the
appropriate box.

Push or Validation reception
----------------------------

Pushes and Validations are notified in two different ways :

*  By notification in the Production interface
*  By email

Each notification mode has a permanent link allowing to display in Phraseanet
Lightbox. The *Pushes* and *Validations*  received are displayed as received
baskets in the Production work area. They are also regrouped in Phraseanet
Lightbox.
