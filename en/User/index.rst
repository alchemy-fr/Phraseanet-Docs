an approach by user case:

  Phraseanet to search and export media.
* The section :doc:`Manage and animate an asset<Guide/Animate>` is for the users
  that exploit a media asset in Phraseanet.
* :doc:`Lightbox<Guide/Lightbox>` is a particular interface because it enables
  access to pushed media, webcasted in a particular interface. It answers the
  pushed information problem.
* The section :doc:`Administration<Guide/Administration>` is dedicated to the
  management and setting. It is targeted to administrators and managers that
  implement digital media management projects.
