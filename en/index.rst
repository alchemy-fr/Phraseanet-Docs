Welcome to Phraseanet 4.1's documentation
=========================================

Open source DAM system
----------------------

`Phraseanet`_ is a Digital Asset Management system (DAM for short) targeting the
professionals needs. It's created and maintained by the French company
`Alchemy`_.

Phraseanet can store, manage and share a wide range of digital resources such as
images, videos, audio or office documents within working groups of any size.

As a *100% Web* application, it runs in a modern web browser.

Built upon standard components, *Phraseanet* settles on Linux, OS X or Windows
servers and is based on common software components such as Elasticsearch, MySQL,
PHP or Apache.
Other third-party software libraries participate to *Phraseanet*.
Some of these are `developed by Alchemy <http://phraseanet.github.com/>`_,
while some others not.
