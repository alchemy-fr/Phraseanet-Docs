Plugins configuration
=====================

If they allow it, plugins can have an graphic interface to act on the
configuration.

If this is the case, go to Phraseanet Admin interface then click on the Plugins
item in the left side menu.

Because each plugin is different, please refer to *manifest* file associated
with installed plugin.
