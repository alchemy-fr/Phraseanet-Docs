      (ex: phraseanet-backup-date).
    * Place the latest sources where the previous one were.
* Overwrite the config folder with the one of the previous installation.
* Reload Apache or Nginx server, eventually PHP-FPM to support the new
  version of the extension.

  of Phraseanet you update. In a terminal, in the application root directory,
  run the following command:
