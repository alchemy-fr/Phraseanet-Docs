Plugins
=======

Phraseanet has a plugin system allowing services customization (log,
authentication) and views (customized home pages).

A Phraseanet plugin is a directory containing a
**manifest.json** file that describes the plugin, a **composer.json** file that
resolves its dependencies and a **public** directory that contains any public
resources (icons, css, js, etc...).
