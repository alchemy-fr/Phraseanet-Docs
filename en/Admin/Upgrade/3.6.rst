Version 3.6
===========

Changes :
-----------------

* A major schema enhancement happens for meta values. Multivalued values were
  stored serialized and are now stored separatly.
  Two routes are modified : :doc:`Records/Metadatas
  </Devel/API/V1/Route/Records/Metadatas>` and :doc:`Records/SetMetadatas
  </Devel/API/V1/Route/Records/SetMetadatas>`.
  A route has been added to make it easy to display caption :
  :doc:`Records/Caption </Devel/API/V1/Route/Records/Caption>`.

.. seealso::

    :doc:`Complete documentation to upgrade to API 1.1
    </Devel/API/Changelog>`

.. warning::

        As this is a schema change, there is no backward compatibility
        with API 1.0 which is no longer supported in Phraseanet 3.6.

        Please upgrade your adapters before upgrade Phraseanet.
