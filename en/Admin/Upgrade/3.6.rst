Version 3.6
===========

Changes :
-----------------

  * A major schema enhancement happens for meta values. Multivalued values were
    stored serialized and are now stored separatly.
    Two routes are modified : records/metadatas and records/setmetadatas.
    A route has been added to make it easy to display caption : records/caption.

  .. seealso:: :doc:`Complete documentation to upgrade to API 1.1 <APIupgrade>`

  .. warning::

        As this is a schema change, there is no backward compatibility
        with API 1.0 which is no longer supported in Phraseanet 3.6.

        Please upgrade your adapters before upgrade Phraseanet.
